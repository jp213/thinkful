The fueleconomy database for this challenge is located on the same server you’ve used in previous checkpoints in this module.
The name of the database is fueleconomy. It contains EPA fuel economy statistics for different makes and models of vehicles from 1984 to 2015.

Questions
To complete this challenge, you should submit a single text file that contains the SQL query required for each question.
In some cases, you may also need a specific answer. Plan to spend some time going over your answers with your mentor during your next session.

1. How many records are in the vehicles table? Provide the query you’d use to determine this as well as the answer to the question.
   There are 33442 records in the vehicles table.  I used the following query:
   SELECT COUNT(*)
   FROM vehicles;

2. Write a query that returns all the records in the vehicles table.
   SELECT *
   FROM vehicles;

3. Write a query that returns the id, make, and model fields for all the records for 2010 vehicles.
   SELECT id, make, model
   FROM vehicles
   WHERE year = 2010;

4. Write a query that returns the count of vehicles from 2010. Also provide the answer.
   The count is 1109.  I used the following query:
   SELECT id, make, model
   FROM vehicles
   WHERE year = 2010;
   
5. Write a query that returns the count of vehicles in the vehicles table between the years 2010 and 2015, inclusive.
   Provide the query as well as the answer.  The count is 5995.  I used the following query:
   SELECT COUNT(year)
   FROM vehicles
   WHERE year BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015;

6. Write a query that returns the count of vehicles from the years 1990, 2000, and 2010. Provide the query and the result.
   The count is 3026.  I used the following query:
   SELECT COUNT(year)
   FROM vehicles
   WHERE year IN (1990, 2000, 2010);

7. Write a query that returns the count of all records between 1987 and 2005, exclusive of the years 1990 and 2000.
   The count is 17235.  I used the following query:
   SELECT COUNT(*)
   FROM vehicles
   WHERE (year BETWEEN 1987 AND 2005) AND year NOT IN (1990, 2000);

8. Write a query that returns the year, make, model, and a field called average_mpg that calculates the average highway/city fuel consumption.
   (For example, if hwy is 24 and cty is 20, then average_mpg = (24 + 20)/ 2 = 22.)
   SELECT year, make, model, round((CAST((hwy + cty) AS NUMERIC) / 2), 1) AS average_mpg
   FROM vehicles;

9. Write a query that returns the year, make, model, and a text field displaying “X highway; Y city.”
   (For example, if hwy is 24 and cty is 20, then hwy_city is “24 highway; 20 city.”)
   SELECT year, make, model, CONCAT(hwy, ' highway; ', cty, ' city.') AS hwy_city
   FROM vehicles;

10. Write a query that returns the id, make, model, and year for all records that have NULL for either the cyl or displ fields.
    SELECT id, make, model, year
    FROM vehicles
    WHERE cyl IS NULL OR displ IS NULL;

11. Write a query that returns all fields for records with rear-wheel drive and diesel vehicles since 2000, inclusive.
    Also sort by year and highway mileage, both descending. Hint: to view the distinct values in a field, you can use DISTINCT.
    For example, use SELECT DISTINCT(drive) FROM vehicles;
    to get the unique values that appear in that field, or use SELECT DISTINCT(fuel) FROM vehicles;.
    SELECT *
    FROM vehicles
    WHERE (drive ILIKE 'r%' AND fuel ILIKE 'd%') AND year >= 2000
    ORDER BY year DESC, hwy DESC;

12. Write a query that counts the number of vehicles that are either Fords or Chevrolets and either compact cars or 2-seaters.
    Provide the query and the answer.  The count is 612.  I used the following query:
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM vehicles
    WHERE (make = 'Ford' OR make LIKE 'Chev%') AND (class LIKE 'Compact%' OR class = 'Two Seaters');

13. Write a query that returns the records for 10 vehicles with the highest highway fuel mileage.
    SELECT *
    FROM vehicles
    ORDER BY hwy DESC
    LIMIT 10;

14. Write a query that returns all the records of vehicles since the year 2000 whose model name starts with a capital X.
    Sort the list A through Z by make. What happens when you use a lowercase “x” instead?
    SELECT *
    FROM vehicles
    WHERE year >= 2000 AND model LIKE 'X%'
    ORDER BY make;
    This query returns 469 records (rows).  Using a lowercase "x" returns only 40 rows, and they're all Scions.

15. Write a query that returns the count of records where the “cyl” field is NULL. Provide the query as well as the answer.
    The count is 58.  I used the following query:
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM vehicles
    WHERE cyl IS NULL;

16. Write a query that returns the count of all records before the year 2000 that got more than 20 mpg hwy
    and had greater than 3 liters displacement (“displ” field). Provide the query as well as the answer.
    The count is 1964.  I used the following query:
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM vehicles
    WHERE year < 2000 AND hwy > 20 AND displ > 3;

17. Write a query that returns all records whose model name has a (capital) X in its 3rd position.
    Hint: make sure your wildcard operator accommodates for any characters after the “X”!
    SELECT *
    FROM vehicles
    WHERE model LIKE '__X%';
